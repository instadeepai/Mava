## Welcome to Mava! ü¶Å

[**Installation**](#installation-)
| [**Quickstart**](#quickstart-)
| [**Documentation**](https://id-mava.readthedocs.io/)

Mava is a library for building multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems. Mava provides useful components, abstractions, utilities and tools for MARL and allows for simple scaling for multi-process system training and execution while providing a high level of flexibility and composability. Originating in the Research Team at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), Mava is now developed jointly with the open-source community. ‚ÄúMava‚Äù means experience, or wisdom, in Xhosa - one of South Africa‚Äôs eleven official languages.

To join us in these efforts, please feel free to reach out, raise issues or read our [contribution guidelines](#contributing-) (or just star üåü to stay up to date with the latest developments)!

<hr>

üëã **UPDATE - 01/10/2022**: In the next few weeks, we will release our first JAX system! Using a more modular and flexible build method, with many more developments to come soon. These will include more components and utilities, state-of-the-art system implementations, notebooks and tutorials as well as detailed benchmarking and performance guides. After this release, our TF2-based systems will be deprecated. To still use them please install [`v0.1.3`](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava/releases/tag/0.1.3) of Mava (e.g. `pip install id-mava==0.1.3`). Please note, we will no longer be supporting these systems after our next release (`v0.1.4`).

### Overview ü¶ú

- ü•ë **Modular building blocks for MARL**: modular abstractions and [components](https://id-mava.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/components/) for MARL to facilitate building multi-agent systems at scale.
- üç¨ **Environment Wrappers**: easily connect to your favourite MARL environment including [SMAC][smac], [PettingZoo][pettingzoo], [Flatland][flatland] and more. For details on our environment wrappers and how to add your own environment, please see [here](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava/blob/develop/mava/wrappers/README.md).
- üéì **Educational Material**: [examples] and [user guides][quickstart] to facilitate Mava's adoption and highlight the added value of JAX-based MARL.

## Installation üé¨

You can install the latest release of Mava as follows:

```bash
pip install id-mava[reverb,jax,envs]
```

You can also install directly from source:

```bash
pip install "id-mava[reverb,jax,envs] @ git+https://github.com/instadeepai/mava.git"
```

We have tested `mava` on Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Note that because the installation of JAX differs depending on your hardware accelerator,
we advise users to explicitly install the correct JAX version (see the [official installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)). For more in-depth instalations guides including Docker builds and virtual environments, please see our [detailed installation guide](DETAILED_INSTALL.md).

## Quickstart ‚ö°

We have a [Quickstart notebook][quickstart] that can be used to quickly create and train your first Multi-Agent System. For more on Mava's implementation details, please visit our [documentation].

## Contributing ü§ù

Please read our [contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to submit pull requests, our Contributor License Agreement and community guidelines.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

Please read our [troubleshooting and FAQs guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
