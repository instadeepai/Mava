# Detailed installation guide

### Docker

#### Using pre-built images

You can pull & run the latest pre-built images from our [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/instadeepct/mava) by specifying the docker image and example/file you want to run.

For example, this will pull the latest mava jax core image and run the `examples/debugging/simple_spread/feedforward/decentralised/run_ippo.py` example:

```
docker run --gpus all -it --rm  -v $(pwd):/home/app/mava -w /home/app/mava instadeepct/mava:jax-core-latest python examples/debugging/simple_spread/feedforward/decentralised/run_ippo.py --base_dir /home/app/mava/logs/
```

* For windows, replace `$(pwd)` with `$(curdir)`.

* You can replace the example with your custom python file.

#### Building the image yourself

1. Build the correct docker image using the `make` command:

    For Windows, before the docker image build, we recommend to first install the package manager [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and run (to install make):

    ```bash
    choco install make
    ```

    1.1 Only Mava core:

    Jax version:

    ```bash
    make build version=jax-core
    ```

    1.2 For **optional** environments:

    * PettingZoo:

        ```
        make build version=pz
        ```

    * SMAC: The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge Environments :

        Install StarCraft II using a bash script, which is a slightly modified version of the script found [here][pymarl]:

        ```
        ./bash_scripts/install_sc2.sh
        ```

        Build Image

        ```
        make build version=sc2
        ```

    * Flatland:

        ```
        make build version=flatland
        ```

    * 2D RoboCup environment

        ```
        make build version=robocup
        ```

    To allow for agent recordings, where agents evaluations are recorded and these recordings are stored in a `/recordings` folder:

    ```
    make build version=[] record=true
    ```

2. Run an example:

    ```bash
    make run example=dir/to/example/example.py
    ```

    For example, `make run example=examples/petting_zoo/sisl/multiwalker/feedforward/decentralised/run_mad4pg.py`.

    Alternatively, run bash inside a docker container with mava installed, `make bash`, and from there examples can be run as follows: `python dir/to/example/example.py`.

    To run an example with tensorboard viewing enabled, you can run

    ```bash
    make run-tensorboard example=dir/to/example/example.py
    ```

    and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:6006/`.

    To run an example where agents are recorded (**ensure you built the image with `record=true`**):

    ```
    make run-record example=dir/to/example/example.py
    ```

    Where example, is an example with recording available e.g. `examples/debugging/simple_spread/feedforward/decentralised/run_maddpg_record.py`.

### Python virtual environment

1. If not using docker, we strongly recommend using a
    [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
    to manage your dependencies in order to avoid version conflicts. Please note that since Launchpad only supports Linux based OSes, using a python virtual environment will only work in these cases:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv mava
    source mava/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ```

    1.1  To install the core libraries, including [Reverb](https://github.com/deepmind/reverb) - our storage dataset , Tensorflow and [Launchpad](https://github.com/deepmind/launchpad) - for distributed agent support :

    * Install swig for box2d:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install swig -y
    ```

    * Install core dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install id-mava[jax,reverb]
    ```

    * Or for the latest version of mava from source (**you can do this for all pip install commands below for the latest depedencies**):

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava#egg=id-mava[reverb,jax]
    ```

    **If you are using `jax` and `CUDA`, you also need to run the following:**

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
    ```

    1.2 For **optional** environments:
    * PettingZoo:

        ```
        pip install id-mava[pz]
        ```

    * Flatland:

        ```
        pip install id-mava[flatland]
        ```

    * 2D RoboCup environment:

        A local install has only been tested using the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system.
        The installation can be performed by running the RoboCup bash script while inside the Mava
        python virtual environment.

        ```bash
        ./bash_scripts/install_robocup.sh
        ```

    * StarCraft II:

        First install StarCraft II

        ```bash
        ./bash_scripts/install_sc2.sh
        ```

        Then set SC2PATH to the location of 3rdparty/StarCraftII, e.g. :

        ```
        export SC2PATH="/home/Documents/Code/Mava/3rdparty/StarCraftII"
        ```

        Then install the environment wrapper

        ```bash
        pip install id-mava[sc2]
        ```

3. Developing features for mava

    When developing features for MAVA one can replace the `id-mava` part of the `pip install` with a `.` (or mava's directory) in order to install all dependencies.  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/instadeepai/mava.git
    pip install -e "mava[reverb,jax]"
    ```

    This installs the mava dependencies into your current environment, but uses your local copy of mava, instead of the one stored inside of your environments package directory.

4. Run an example:

    ```
    python dir/to/example/example.py
    ```

    For certain examples and extra functionality such as the use of Atari environments, environment wrappers, gpu support and agent episode recording, we also have a list of [optional installs](OPTIONAL_INSTALL.md).

### Optional Installs

1. **Optional**: To install ROM files for Atari-Py using [AutoROM](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/AutoROM).

   ```
   pip install autorom && AutoROM
   ```

   Then follow the on-screen instructions.

   You might also need to download unrar-free:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install unrar-free
   ```

2. **Optional**: To install opencv for [Supersuit](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/SuperSuit) environment wrappers.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6  -y
    ```

3. **Optional**: For GPU support follow NVIDIA's cuda download [instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) or download cudatoolkit through [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/cudatoolkit).

4. **Optional**: To log episodes in video/gif format, using the `Monitor` wrapper.

* Install `xvfb` to run a headless/fake screen and `ffmpeg` to record video.

    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y xvfb ffmpeg
    ```

* Setup fake display:

    ```
    xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1400x900x24" bash
    python [script.py]
    ```

    or

    ```
    xvfb-run -a python [script.py]
    ```

* Install `array2gif`, if you would like to save the episode in gif format.

    ```
    pip install .[record_episode]
    ```

* Note when rendering StarCraft II it may be necessary to point to the correct C++ version like this:

  ```bash
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
  python  examples/smac/feedforward/decentralised/run_ippo.py
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ python  examples/smac/feedforward/decentralised/run_ippo.py
  ```
