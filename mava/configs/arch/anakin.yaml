# --- Anakin config ---

# --- Training ---
seed: 42
num_envs: 16  # Number of vectorised environments per device.
num_updates: 1000 # Number of updates
total_timesteps: ~ # Set the total environment steps.
# If unspecified, it's derived from num_updates; otherwise, num_updates adjusts based on this value.


# --- Evaluation ---
evaluation_greedy: False # Evaluate the policy greedily. If True the policy will select
  # an action which corresponds to the greatest logit. If false, the policy will sample
  # from the logits.
num_eval_episodes: 32 # Number of episodes to evaluate per evaluation.
num_evaluation: 200 # Number of evenly spaced evaluations to perform during training.
absolute_metric: True # Whether the absolute metric should be computed. For more details
  # on the absolute metric please see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10485
