# ---Environment Configs---
defaults:
  - _self_

# Possible envs: [ant_4x2, halfcheetah_6x1, hopper_3x1, humanoid_9|8, walker2d_2x3]
env_name: ant_4x2
scenario:
  task_name: ant_4x2  # In this case: env_name = task_name

kwargs:
  episode_length: 1000
  homogenisation_method: None #Default is None. [max, concat] if the dims of observations and actions are not homegenous across agents.
  # Note: "max" adds one-hot for the agent's ID. Homogeneous tasks: ant_4x2, walker2d_2x3

actions_type: continuous # The type of actions used in this env (Note: use the mlp_continuous.yaml in this case).
clip_action: 1  # clip_action = 0.4 if env_name == "humanoid_9|8" else 1
# This is used to transform the action interval: IF action in [-clip_action, clip_action] -> clip_action * action
