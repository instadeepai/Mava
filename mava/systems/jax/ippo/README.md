# Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO)

This system is an extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) ([Schulman et al., 2017]) algorithm for the multi-agent setting. The system is currently trained in a decentralised manner and is hence termed IPPO. Centralised training, termed MAPPO, will be realeased shortly. For recent experimental results concerning Multi-agent PPO, see the following paper by [Yu et al. (2021)].
