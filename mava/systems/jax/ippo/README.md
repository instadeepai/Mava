# Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)

This system is an extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) ([Schulman et al., 2017]) algorithm to the multi-agent setting. The system can be trained in a decentralised or centralised manner using a shared critic network. For recent experimental results concerning MAPPO, see the follow paper by [Yu et al. (2021)].
