# Q Learning

We provide 2 Q-Learning based systems:
* [rec-IQL](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava/tree/feat/develop/mava/systems/q_learning/anakin/rec_iql.py): a multi-agent recurrent DQN implementation with double DQN.
* [rec-QMIX](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava/tree/feat/develop/mava/systems/q_learning/anakin/rec_qmix.py): an implementation of QMIX.
