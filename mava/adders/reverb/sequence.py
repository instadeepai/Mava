        Args:
          client: See docstring for BaseAdder.
          sequence_length: The fixed length of sequences we wish to add.
          period: The period with which we add sequences. If less than
            sequence_length, overlapping sequences are added. If equal to
            sequence_length, sequences are exactly non-overlapping.
          net_ids_to_keys: A list of network names to convert from integers to
            strings.
          table_network_config: A dictionary mapping table names to lists of
            network names.
          delta_encoded: If `True` (False by default) enables delta encoding, see
            `Client` for more information.
          priority_fns: See docstring for BaseAdder.
          max_in_flight_items: The maximum number of items allowed to be "in flight"
            at the same time. See `block_until_num_items` in
            `reverb.TrajectoryWriter.flush` for more info.
          end_of_episode_behavior:  Determines how sequences at the end of the
            episode are handled (default `EndOfEpisodeBehavior.ZERO_PAD`). See
            the docstring for `EndOfEpisodeBehavior` for more information.
          chunk_length: Deprecated and unused.
          pad_end_of_episode: If True (default) then upon end of episode the current
            sequence will be padded (with observations, actions, etc... whose values
            are 0) until its length is `sequence_length`. If False then the last
            sequence in the episode may have length less than `sequence_length`.
          break_end_of_episode: If 'False' (True by default) does not break
            sequences on env reset. In this case 'pad_end_of_episode' is not used.
          use_next_extras: If true extras will be processed the same way observations
          are processed. If false extras will be processed as actions are processed.
