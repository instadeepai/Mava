          period: The period with which we add sequences. If less than
            sequence_length, overlapping sequences are added. If equal to
            sequence_length, sequences are exactly non-overlapping.
          delta_encoded: If `True` (False by default) enables delta encoding, see
            `Client` for more information.
          chunk_length: Number of timesteps grouped together before delta encoding
            and compression. See `Client` for more information.
          priority_fns: See docstring for BaseAdder.
          pad_end_of_episode: If True (default) then upon end of episode the current
            sequence will be padded (with observations, actions, etc... whose values
            are 0) until its length is `sequence_length`. If False then the last
            sequence in the episode may have length less than `sequence_length`.
          break_end_of_episode: If 'False' (True by default) does not break
            sequences on env reset. In this case 'pad_end_of_episode' is not used.
          max_in_flight_items: The maximum number of items allowed to be "in flight"
