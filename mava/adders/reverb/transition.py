    """An N-step transition adder.

    This will buffer a sequence of N timesteps in order to form a single N-step
    transition which is added to reverb for future retrieval.
    For N=1 the data added to replay will be a standard one-step transition which
    takes the form:
          (s_t, a_t, r_t, d_t, s_{t+1}, e_t)
    where:
      s_t = state observation at time t
      a_t = the action taken from s_t
      r_t = reward ensuing from action a_t
      d_t = environment discount ensuing from action a_t. This discount is
          applied to future rewards after r_t.
      e_t [Optional] = extra data that the agent persists in replay.
    For N greater than 1, transitions are of the form:
          (s_t, a_t, R_{t:t+n}, D_{t:t+n}, s_{t+N}, e_t),
    where:
      s_t = State (observation) at time t.
      a_t = Action taken from state s_t.
      g = the additional discount, used by the agent to discount future returns.
      R_{t:t+n} = N-step discounted return, i.e. accumulated over N rewards:
            R_{t:t+n} := r_t + g * d_t * r_{t+1} + ...
                             + g^{n-1} * d_t * ... * d_{t+n-2} * r_{t+n-1}.
      D_{t:t+n}: N-step product of agent discounts g_i and environment
        "discounts" d_i.
            D_{t:t+n} := g^{n-1} * d_{t} * ... * d_{t+n-1},
        For most environments d_i is 1 for all steps except the last,
        i.e. it is the episode termination signal.
      s_{t+n}: The "arrival" state, i.e. the state at time t+n.
      e_t [Optional]: A nested structure of any 'extras' the user wishes to add.

    Notes:
      - At the beginning and end of episodes, shorter transitions are added.
        That is, at the beginning of the episode, it will add:
              (s_0 -> s_1), (s_0 -> s_2), ..., (s_0 -> s_n), (s_1 -> s_{n+1})
        And at the end of the episode, it will add:
              (s_{T-n+1} -> s_T), (s_{T-n+2} -> s_T), ... (s_{T-1} -> s_T).
      - We add the *first* `extra` of each transition, not the *last*, i.e.
          if extras are provided, we get e_t, not e_{t+n}.
