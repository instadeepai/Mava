            expected_sequences: The sequence of items that are expected to be created
                by calling the adder's `add_first()` method on `first` and `add()`
                on all of the elements in `steps`.

                agents = {"agent_0", "agent_1", "agent_2"}.
            repeat_episode_times: How many times to run an episode.
