        Args:
            max_sequence_length: The fixed length of sequences we wish to add.
            period: The period with which we add sequences. If less than
                sequence_length, overlapping sequences are added. If equal to
                sequence_length, sequences are exactly non-overlapping.
            first: The first `dm_env.TimeStep` that is used to call
                `base.ReverbAdder.add_first()`.
            steps: A sequence of (action, timestep) tuples that are passed to
                `base.ReverbAdder.add()`.
            expected_sequences: The sequence of items that are expected to be created
                by calling the adder's `add_first()` method on `first` and `add()`
                on all of the elements in `steps`.
            agents: Dict containing agent names, e.g.
                agents = {"agent_0", "agent_1", "agent_2"}.
            end_behavior: How end of episode should be handled.
            repeat_episode_times: How many times to run an episode.
                end_behavior: How end of episode should be handled.
